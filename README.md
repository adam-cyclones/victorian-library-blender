_Please note that Victorian is a real library but I wanted to share this before hand, if you use it please strip out all Victorian and change the readme to suit your needs_

# Victorian Asset Library Installer

## Description:

The Victorian Asset Library Installer is a Blender addon designed to easily integrate the "Victorian" asset library into Blender's native asset browser. Once installed, users can access Victorian-themed assets directly from Blender's interface without needing to navigate through file systems or external resources.

## Features:

- **Simple Interface**: A panel in Blender's 3D view UI under the category "Victorian" contains a button to install the asset library.
- **Easy Installation**: With just a single click, the Victorian asset library is added to Blender's asset browser.
- **Smart Detection**: The addon checks if the Victorian asset library is already installed to prevent duplication.

## Installation:

1. Download the addon (usually a `.zip` file).
2. Open Blender.
3. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install.
4. Navigate to the downloaded `.zip` file and select it.
5. Ensure the addon is activated by checking the checkbox.
6. A new tab named "Victorian" should now appear in the right-hand toolbar of the 3D view.

## Usage:

1. After installing the addon, switch to the 3D view in Blender.
2. On the right-hand toolbar, navigate to the "Victorian" tab.
3. Click on the "Install Victorian Asset Library" button.
4. If successfully installed, a notification will inform the user. If the asset library was already installed, a notification will mention this as well.
5. The Victorian asset library can now be accessed through Blender's asset browser.

## Requirements:

- Blender version: 3.6.0 or newer.
- The addon assumes the presence of an `assets.blend` file in the addon's directory. Ensure it's present for the addon to work correctly.
